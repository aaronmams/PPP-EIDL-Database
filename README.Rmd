This is a code repository containing mostly R code that I used to manage a cloud MySQL database containing public data from the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Programs. 

Information about these programs can be obtained here:

The organization of this project is as follows:

1. I downloaded all of the PPP and EIDL data (they are publicly available in zip files from the link provided above)
2. I created a Google Cloud Project and configured a cloud MySQL Database for the project
2. I developed some R routines to clean and standardize the data
3. Using R's ```DBI``` library I pushed these data to the cloud MySQL Database
